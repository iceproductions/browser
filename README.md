## 👾 Features

* **🚫 Built in ad-blocker** - We all hate ads, so we releave the pain by having a ad-blocker built in. No downloads, nothing.
* **💬 Fancy Discord Rich Presence** - Tell your Discord Friends what page you're looking at, or if you're just Idle on the home screen...
* **💻 Minimalistic UI** - Forget Chrome, bye bye Firefox, see you later IE and Edge. Our UI beats all of them.
* **🖼 Dot Overlay** - A neat little overlay, which has bookmarks, a search box, downloads and more.
* **🚩 Tab Groups** - Organize your tabs in a breeze.
* **🎨 Customization** - Edit your Dot experience to what you want.
* **🔖 Bookmarks & History** - Keep track of your favourite pages and your browsing history.
* **🌥 Weather Updates** - A little card on the overlay telling you about the weather in your location.
* **⚪ Dot Account** - Login to your Dot Account to keep your bookmarks, history, settings and location saved.
